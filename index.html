            This is Gravity Chess, it gets its name from gravity. <br />
            All the pieces (except for pawns and kings) are affected by gravity, meaning they will fall down. <br />
            The white pieces will fall to the white side and the black pieces to the black side. <br />
            This has some interesting implications, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>Bishops can change what color they're on.</li>
                <li>Rooks are kind of like lasers, and can't get off the back rank.</li>
                <li>Pawns are way more important and are possibly even necessary for a checkmate.</li>
                <li>Knights are basically useless, since they need to jump up on other pieces.</li>
            </ul>
            I have no clue if this is a functional version of chess or not, but I wanted to make this variant, so I did.
